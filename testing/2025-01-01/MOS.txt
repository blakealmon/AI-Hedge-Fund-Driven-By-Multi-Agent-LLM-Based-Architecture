DECISION: BUY
RATIONALE:
Based on the proposed investment plan and the detailed analysis, it is clear that the recommendation is to sell. The arguments made against maintaining a position in Blackboard carry substantial weight due to several concerning factors:

1. **Overvaluation and Premium Market Pricing**: The current market cap of $12 billion in relation to a mere 10% revenue growth rate indicates that the stock is overvalued. Such a high valuation can indeed lead to a sharp correction if growth begins to decelerate.

2. **Intensifying Competitive Threats**: The presence of strong competitors, especially tech giants like Google and Microsoft, adds to the pressure on Blackboard's market position. The potential erosion of market share is a significant risk that investors must weigh heavily.

3. **Market Risks and Economic Uncertainty**: Global macroeconomic challenges pose a real risk to spending in the education sector. If institutional budgets tighten, Blackboard could experience a decline in revenue, which would be detrimental to its stock price.

4. **Negative Catalysts and Operational Risks**: Concerns regarding insider transactions and the companyâ€™s reliance on institutional funding highlight potential vulnerabilities. Any adverse developments in these areas could lead to a loss of investor confidence and a decline in stock value.

Given the context and the arguments supporting a sell decision, this investment plan aligns with the historical observation that overvalued tech stocks often face significant declines when market sentiment shifts or when growth slows. 

Therefore, considering the comprehensive insight into the risk factors associated with maintaining an investment in Blackboard, I firmly recommend reducing exposure to avoid potential downturns.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **BUY**
